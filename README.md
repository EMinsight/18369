# 18.369(J)/8.315(J): Mathematical Methods in Nanophotonics

This is the repository of course materials for the [18.369(J)/8.315(J)](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m18a.html#18.369) course at MIT, taught by Prof. [Steven G. Johnson](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/), in Spring 2020.  (This course is offered once every two years.)

Syllabus
--------

> **Tired of doing electromagnetism like it's 1865?**
>
> _Find out what solid-state physics has brought to [8.02](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2007/) in the last 20 years, in this new course surveying the physics and mathematics of nanophotonics—electromagnetic waves in **media structured on the scale of the wavelength**._
>
> _In this regime, which is the basis for everything from iridescent butterfly wings to distributed-feedback lasers and integrated optical devices to the next generation of optical fibers, the 140–year-old analytical techniques you learned in 8.02 aren't as useful. Instead, we will cover computational methods combined with high-level algebraic techniques borrowed from solid-state quantum mechanics: linear algebra and eigensystems, group theory, Bloch's theorem and conservation laws, perturbation methods, and coupled-mode theories, to understand surprising optical phenomena from band gaps to slow light to nonlinear filters._
>
> For beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates.


**Lectures**: Tues-Thurs 11am–12:30pm (4-153). **Office Hours:** Tues. 4–5pm (2-345). TA/grader: [Chenyang Shao](http://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.php?pid=2035).

**Probable topics**: _Methods_: linear algebra & eigensystems for Maxwell's equations, symmetry groups and representation theory, Bloch's theorem, numerical eigensolver methods, time and frequency-domain computation, perturbation theory, coupled-mode theories, waveguide theory, adiabatic transitions. _Optical phenomena_: photonic crystals & band gaps, anomalous diffraction, mechanisms for optical confinement, optical fibers (new & old), nonlinearities, integrated optical devices.

**Grading**: 33% problem sets (weekly/biweekly). 33% take-home mid-term exam (Posted **April 20**, due **April 21**.). 34% final project (proposal due April 14, project due May 12).

* Psets will be [submitted electronically via Stellar](https://learning-modules.mit.edu/gradebook/index.html?uuid=/course/18/sp20/18.369).  Submit a good-quality PDF *scan* of any handwritten solutions (or a PDF printout of computer output).

**Collaboration policy**: Talk to anyone you want to and read anything you want to, with three exceptions: First, you **may not refer to homework solutions from the previous terms** in which I taught 18.369. Second, make a solid effort to solve a problem on your own before discussing it with classmates or googling. Third, no matter whom you talk to or what you read, write up the solution on your own, without having their answer in front of you.

**Books**: [Photonic Crystals: Molding the Flow of Light (Second Edition)](http://ab-initio.mit.edu/book) (**readable online**). (This book is at an undergraduate level and 18.369/8.315 is somewhat more advanced, but the book should provide a useful foundation.)

Useful (but not required) books (available in the library): [Group Theory and Its Applications in Physics](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-80021-4) by Inui et al. ([readable online](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-80021-4) via MIT), and _Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics_ by Michael Tinkham.

**Final projects:** A typical project will be to find some interesting nanophotonic structure/phenomenon in the literature (chapter 10 of the book may be a helpful guide to some possibilities), reproduce it (usually in 2d only, so that the simulations are quick), using (e.g.) the numerical software ([Meep](https://github.com/stevengj/meep) and/or [MPB](https://github.com/stevengj/mpb)) introduced in the course/psets (other useful free/open-source software: [SCUFF-EM](http://homerreid.dyndns.org/scuff-em/) and [S4](https://web.stanford.edu/group/fan/S4/)), and extend/analyze it in some further way (try some other variation on the geometry, etc.). Then write up the results in a 7-15 page report (in the format of a journal article, ideally [Phys. Rev. A](http://pra.aps.org) style, including figures, a comprehensive review of related work, etcetera)—reports should be written for a target audience of your classmates in 18.369/8.315, and should explain what you are doing at that level. Projects should _not_ be a rehash of work you've already done in previous terms for your research (but may be some extension/digression thereof).

**Prerequisites**: 18.303, 8.07, or permission of instructor. (Basically, some experience with partial differential equations and linear algebra. e.g. 8.05, 8.07, 6.013, 3.21, 2.062 are all good background.) This is a graduate-level course aimed at beginning graduate students and suitably advanced undergraduates.

Supplementary lecture notes will be made available as the term progresses.

Lecture Summaries and Handouts
------------------------------

### Lecture 1: 4 Feb 2020

**Handouts:** syllabus (this web page), [introductory slides](notes/18.369-intro.pdf), [pset 1](psets/pset1.pdf) (due Thur Feb 13).

Motivation and introduction: this class is about electromagnetism where the wavelength is neither very large (quasi-static) nor very small (ray optics), and the analytical and computational methods we can use to understand phenomena in materials that are structured on the wavelength scale. In that situation, there are very few cases that can be solved analytically, but lots of interesting phenomena that we can derive from the _structure_ of the equations.

We start by setting up the source-free Maxwell equations as a linear eigenproblem, which will allow us to bring all of the machinery of linear algebra and (eventually) group theory to bear on this problem without having to solve the PDE explicitly (which is usually impossible to do analytically).

Notational introductions: Hilbert spaces (vector space + inner product), notation for inner products and states (magnetic fields etc.). Defined the adjoint (denoted †) of linear operators and Hermitian operators (Â=Â†).

Showed that the Maxwell eigen-operator ∇×ε⁻¹∇× is Hermitian for real ε (by showing that ∇× is Hermitian). The Maxwell operator is also positive semidefinite for ε>0, and it follows that the eigenfrequencies are real.

**Further reading:** See chapter 2 of the _Photonic Crystals_ textbook for Maxwell's equations as an eigenproblem etc. For a more sophisticated treatment of Hilbert spaces, adjoints, and other topics in functional analysis, a good text is _Basic Classes of Linear Operators_ by Gohberg et al. The basics of electromagnetism in macroscopic media (ε and μ) are covered in any non-freshman electromagnetism textbook, e.g. _Classical Electrodynamics_ by Jackson or _Introduction to Electromagnetism_ by Griffiths.

### Lecture 2: 6 Feb

**Handouts:** [representation theory summary](notes/representation-theory.pdf)

Simple one-dimensional example of fields in metallic cavity, showed that consequences match predictions from linear algebra.

Discussed consequences of symmetry, and in particular showed that mirror symmetry implies even/odd solutions. Discussed subtleties of mirror symmetries for electromagnetism: although the E and H fields seem to have opposite symmetry, they don't, because H is a pseudovector. Defined general rotation operators _R̂_ for vector and pseudovector fields.

Gave a simple 2d example of fields in a 2d metal box, and showed that the symmetries are more complicated, and may include degeneracies. In order to understand this, we need to understand the relationship of different symmetry operations to one another — this relationship is expressed more precisely by the _group_ of symmetry operators, which we will get to next time.

**Further reading:** Chapter 3 of the photonic-crystals text. See the Inui textbook, or many similar sources, on group theory; the most helpful in this context are the many "group theory in physics" books.

### Lecture 3: 11 Feb

Defined groups, and group representations, irreducibility, and partner functions, conjugacy classes and most of the other things on the handout, with some examples (the square symmetry group and the mirror symmetry group). (Briefly covered everything on the handout _except_ Great Orthogonality Theorem, character tables, projection operators, and product representations.)

Proved that all eigenfunctions can be chosen to transform as partner functions of an irreducible representation of the symmetry group (also called a "basis" of the representation), with the dimension of the representation given by the degree of degeneracy of the eigenvalue. Proved that all representations derived from a given eigenvalue are equivalent. Noted that orthonormal eigenfunctions give a unitary representation (outlined proof but did not work it through).

If the representation is irreducible, then the degeneracy comes from the symmetry of the system. If the representation is reducible, then we call it an **accidental degeneracy** (not coming from symmetry). Accidental degeneracies rarely happen by accident—usually the degeneracy has somehow been forced—so generically we only expect degeneracies if there are >1 dimensional irreps.

Build the simple character table for the {E,σ} mirror-symmetry group, reprising the previous result that in mirror-symmetric systems we expect even/odd eigenfunctions, and we don't expect (non-accidental) degeneracies (unless there are additional symmetries).

**Further reading:** Chapter 3 of the text, but this doesn't get into representation theory. See e.g. _Group Theory and Its Applications in Physics_ by Inui et al. (especially sections 4.1, 6.1, and 6.2) or _Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics_ by Michael Tinkham (especially sections 3-1 and 3-6), or any book with a similar title.  Character tables for all of the common symmetry groups are tabulated in both textbooks and online, e.g. see this [page on the C4v group](http://symmetry.jacobs-university.de/cgi-bin/group.cgi?group=404&option=4). See Inui section 6.6 on projection operators.

### Lecture 4: 13 Feb

**Handout:** [notes on decomposition of functions into partner functions](notes/irrep-decompose.pdf);  [pset 1 solutions](pset1/pset1sol.pdf); [pset 2](psets/pset2.pdf) (due Thurs Feb 27).

Using the rules from the representation theory handout, we build up the character table for the symmetry group of the square (called _C_4v). Then, look at the eigenfunction solutions that we previously had for this case, and show how we could classify them into the various irreducible representations.

Looked at the projection operator (see handout) in more detail and gave some graphical examples of how we can use it to decompose a function into partner functions.

Used the projection operator to classify the modes of the square cavity, and in particular found that some of the modes are accidental degeneracies. In this way, we are able to find representatives of all five irreps. Conversely, by looking at the irreps, we can guess some of the types of eigenfunctions that should appear, inferring the sign pattern from the character table.

Showed how we can apply the projection operator to "random" functions to find partners of different irreps, even without an eigenproblem, and to "sketch" the qualitative features that we expect to find in the eigenfunctions. And, once we have partner functions, we can obtain representation matrices for each irrep (useful for 2+ dimensional irreps). As an example, looked at ψ(x,y)=1, x, and x2; found in particular that the 2d irrep transforms like {x,y}, i.e. the ordinary 2d rotation matrices.

Next time, we will show the irreducible representation is conserved over time in a linear system, by showing that the projection operator commutes with the time-evolution operator.

**Further reading:** Character tables for all of the common symmetry groups are tabulated in both textbooks and online, e.g. see this [page on the C4v group](http://symmetry.jacobs-university.de/cgi-bin/group.cgi?group=404&option=4). See Inui section 6.6 on projection operators.

### No class: 18 Feb

This is an "MIT Monday" due to the holiday on the previous day.

### Lecture 5: 20 Feb

Guest lecture, [Prof. Marin Soljačić, MIT Physics](https://www.rle.mit.edu/marin/): Novel devices and applications in photonics.

### Lecture 6: 25 Feb

**Handout:** [notes on time evolution and conservation laws](notes/time-evolution.pdf)

The irreducible representation is "conserved" over time in a linear system, because the projection operator commutes with the time-evolution operator.

Defined the time-evolution operator explicitly via an exponentiated operator on the 6-component vector-field (**E**, **H**). Showed that the time-evolution operator is unitary in an appropriate inner product, for lossless materials, and that this leads to conservation of energy.

**Further reading:** See my [Notes on the algebraic structure of wave equations](notes/wave-equations.pdf) for a general discussion of many wave equations, showing that they share the common form dψ/dt D ψ where D is anti-Hermitian. For Poynting's theorem, see any graduate-level book on electromagnetism, e.g. Jackson's _Classical Electrodynamics_. The result is summarized in chapter 2 of the textbook. Beware that matters are more complicated for dispersive media (ones in which ε and μ depend on ω), as discussed briefly in Jackson. A much more complete review of passive dispersive media, including the consequences of passivity for causality etcetera, can be found in our 2014 paper [Speed-of-light limitations in passive linear media](http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj/papers/Welters14.pdf): see in particular the discussion of passivity in section II.B and of "dynamical" energy density in section V.A.
